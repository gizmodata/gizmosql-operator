                          If not set, the default metric will be set to 80% average CPU utilization.

                                to normal per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.

                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.

                          Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed

                          reported here may be larger than the actual capacity when

                          capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only\nlowered
                          if there are no expansion operations in progress and if

                          should ignore PVC updates that change other valid\nresources
